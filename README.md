# rubis-cube-solver

A Rubik's Cube solver is a program or algorithm designed to find a sequence of moves that will solve a scrambled Rubik's Cube and return it to its original solved state. The solver analyses the current state of the cube and generates a series of moves to rearrange the cube's colors and align the individual cubies into their correct positions.
Rubik's Cube solvers utilize various algorithms and techniques, such as graph theory, search algorithms (e.g., depth-first search, breadth-first search), and heuristics. These approaches help efficiently explore the vast number of possible cube configurations and find an optimal or near-optimal solution.
